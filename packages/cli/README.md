_T.B.A_

## Getting Started

Install via npm:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @acot/cli

# or

$ npm install --save-dev @acot/cli puppeteer
```

You can build the configuration file and install the dependent packages with the following commands:

```bash
$ npx acot init
```

And then, the `run` subcommand performs an audit based on the configuration file.

```bash
$ npx acot run
```
